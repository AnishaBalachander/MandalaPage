    <p>
        The word Mandala comes from the ancient Indian language (Sanskrit), which means a Circle or Center. 
        Mandala is drawn from the central point and is surrounded by beautiful patterns and decorations that are connected and interrelated.
        An image of a Mandala can symbolize everything in life that is interconnected and never-ending.

            It reperents the fact that life is infinity and the wholesome of spirit.It allows you to take your mind off of negative things and decrease negativity in your life. 
        Being disconnected from the chaotic world, you can fully focus on yourself as a natural human being and can set your mind toward your ultimate goal. 
             In meditation practice, if you can keep a vision of a Mandala in your mind without distraction, it means that you have achieved success and entered the Mandala. 
             The artistic beauty of the Mandala artwork is not only pleasant to look at, but it is also for better developing your mind potential and achieving a pure enlightened mind.

             Beautiful Mandala art can help promote mindfulness in your life.It is an amazing tool to find your stability for inner peace and your inner sense of self.  
             In Buddhist traditions, Mandala art is a useful aid for monks to focus their mind during meditation in order to restore inner peace and arise wisdom from within.
