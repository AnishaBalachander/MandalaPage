# All About Mandalas 
All About Mandalas, a static HTML page created during the early stages of my web development journey. This project serves as a visual representation of my passion for Mandala art, featuring a simple yet elegant design crafted with HTML and CSS. As a snapshot of my artistic exploration, this showcase is an embodiment of my commitment to both coding and creative expression.
